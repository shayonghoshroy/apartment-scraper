TASK
Each row in the Excel spreadsheet corresponds to a different apartment.
We need to calculate a total score for each apartment based on it's attributes.
The total score will be the sum of individual category scores.
Please research the best possible way to calculate a weighted rank/score.
However, this stackoverflow page is pretty helpful: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66238118/algorithm-to-do-efficient-weighted-ranking
All I want you to do is figure out how to mathematically calculate a total score for an apartment based on the spreadsheet's values of the apartment's attributes.
Test out your idea until you get some good results in Excel, and then I'll translate it to code.
Bottom Line: Create an Excel function that will assign a total score to a single row (apartment)

POSSIBLE PROBLEMS
Sometimes the 'review' column might be equal to "NONE" if nobody has reviewed the apartment, so take that into account.
Don't look at Price or Square Feet. Just look at Price per Square Feet.
Some attributes are deal-breakers, and we should not take the apartment if these conditions are met.
For example, if AC is False, then the score should just be 0.

BASIC IDEA
a_score = a_rank * a_weight
b_score = b_rank * b_weight
c_score = c_rank * c_weight
score = a_score + b_score + c_score

LOCATION
For example. Let's look at neighborhoods (this is how we are going to score location).
These are the all of the possible neighborhoods (i went thru the raw data)
    'Urban Center Irving', 'Grapevine', 'Hurst/Euless/Bedford', 'Valley Ranch', 
    'Las Colinas', 'Koreatown/Gribble', 'Farmers Branch', 'Coppell', 'Irving', 
    'Cypress Waters', 'Carrollton', 'Downtown Carrollton', 'Northwest Dallas', 
    'Original Town'
So, you should probably rank the neighborhoods from most to least desirable:
    1. Urban Center Living
    2. Las Colinas
    3. Valley Ranch
    ...etc...
Then, maybe add a score based on what neighborhood the apartment is in...
    1. Urban Center Living: +14 to the location score 
    2. Las Colinas: +13 to the location score 
    3. Valley Ranch: +12 to the location score 
    ...etc...

WEIGHT
You'll need to calculate a score for each category we care about, following the category ranking that you made.
For example, price per square feet is above location, so it should have a larger weight.

MISC
Feel free to ask me questions about the spreadsheet if you're confused.
Also I want you to check for any weird errors in the spreadsheet.
The scraper is not always 100% perfect.
For example, 
maybe the price per sqft ratio is like 100 or 0
or maybe A/C is False
